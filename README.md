# Community operated machine-readable domain-name blacklist

This repository contains machine-readable list of forbidden online lottery
services, as published by [Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic](https://www.mfcr.cz/cs/soukromy-sektor/hazardni-hry/seznam-nepovolenych-internetovych-her).

The blacklist is accessible in
[`blacklist.txt`](https://csnog.github.io/MFCR-blacklist/blacklist.txt), with one domain name
per line, empty line per page break in the source PDF. The ordering is
preserved. Should a new edition of the blacklist delete an item from the list,
it will get replaced by empty line.
